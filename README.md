Overview
--------

unique_permutation adds a method to the Ruby Array class that will give only unique permutations.
This is more efficient that the built in permutation method as duplicate elements will yield identical permutations.

Setup & Installation

Install with `[sudo] gem install unique_permutation`

Include it in your project's `Gemfile`:

``` ruby
gem 'unique_permutation'
```
